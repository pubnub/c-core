/** @file msstopwatch.h

    A milisecond stopwatch. It's not milisecond accurate, it's just
    the resolution. It might be as bad as 100ms accurate, but, we
    "trade in milliseconds", as a "common denominator".

    We actually want to measure things in seconds, up to several
    minutes, but no more than few hours.

    Such interface is highly "portable", that is, should be easy
    to implement on any platform.

    Keep in mind that this isn't covered by the C standard library.
    clock() can measure only the _CPU_ time (i.e. might not take into
    account that CPU "goes to sleep"), while time() measures "wall
    clock time", thus might "jump around" on time adjustment for
    synchronization or daylight savings or other administrative
    measures.
