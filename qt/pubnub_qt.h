/** Pubnub client "context" for Qt.
 *
 * Represents a Pubnub "context". One context handles at most
 * one Pubnub API transaction/operation at a time.
 * It is similar in the way it works with other C-core Pubnub
 * clients, but there are a few differences that are Qt-specific.
 *
 * Unlike the C++ wrapper, which wraps a "full featured" C-core
 * platform, this is a "Qt-native C-core" of sorts. It provides
 * it's own (Qt) API, while using us much of C-core modules as
 * posible.
 *
 * The outcome of an operation is reported to a user via a Qt
 * signal. There is no "sync" or "callback" interface, though
 * Qt signals are similar to callbacks and we might introduce
 * a "sync" interface.
 *
 * This is not a widget, it is a pure "communication" class,
 * which you can use both in Qt GUI and Qt command line
 * applications.
