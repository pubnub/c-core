/** Maximum number of PubNub contexts. It is used only if the
 * contexts are statically allocated.
 * A context is used to publish messages or subscribe to (get) them.
 *
 * Doesn't make much sense to have less than 1. :)
 * OTOH, don't put too many, as each context takes (for our purposes)
 * a significant amount of memory - app. 128 + @ref PUBNUB_BUF_MAXLEN +
 * @ref PUBNUB_REPLY_MAXLEN bytes.
 *
 * A typical configuration may consist of a single pubnub context for
 * channel subscription and another pubnub context that will periodically
 * publish messages about device status (with timeout lower than message
 * generation frequency).
 *
 * Another typical setup may have a single subscription context and
 * maintain a pool of contexts for each publish call triggered by an
 * external event (e.g. a button push).
 *
 * Of course, there is nothing wrong with having just one context, but
 * you can't publish and subscribe at the same time on the same context.
 * This isn't as bad as it sounds, but may be a source of headaches
 * (lost messages, etc).
