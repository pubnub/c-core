supported-platforms:
  -
    version: PubNub POSIX C SDK
    platforms:
      - Most modern Unix-derived OSes support enough of POSIX to work. For some, like MacOS (OSX) we have special support to handle them not being fully POSIX compliant. Basically, if the OS is released in last 3/4 years, it will most probably work.
      - Some older OSes, like Ubuntu 12.04 or older, may need a few tweaks to work.
      - For TLS/SSL support, we use OpenSSL, and a recent version, 0.9.8 or higher should work. If the user doe snot wish to use TLS/SSL, she does not need OpenSSL at all.

      - Some features require C++11 or newer compliant compiler, if you do not have such a compiler you will not be able to use those features (but will be able to use the rest of the POSIX C++ SDK)
  -
    version: PubNub Windows C SDK
    platforms:
      - Windows 7 or newer with Visual Studio 2008 or newer should work. Newer versions of Clang for Windows and GCC (MINGW or Cygwin) should also work.

      - For TLS/SSL support, we use OpenSSL, and a recent version, 0.9.8 or higher should work. If the user doesn't wish to use TLS/SSL, she does not need OpenSSL at all.
      - Some features require C++11 or newer compliant compiler, if you do not have such a compiler you will not be able to use those features (but will be able to use the rest of the Windows C++ SDK)
