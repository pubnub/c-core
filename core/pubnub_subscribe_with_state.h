/** @file pubnub_subscribe_with_state.h This is the API of "subscribe
    with state" Pubnub transaction.  It is deprecated, provided as a
    workaround for existing users.
*/


/** Starts a "subscribe with state" Pubnub transaction. There are
    various subtle differences in behavior when subscribing with state
    (as opposed to "regular" subscribing without state).

    When auto heartbeat is enabled at compile time both @p channel
    and @p channel_group could be passed as NULL which suggests default
    behaviour(unless it is uuid's very first subscription) in which case
    transaction uses channel and channel groups that are already subscribed.

    It is in all aspects quite similar to pubnub_subscribe(), except that
    the caller should provide a JSON object @p state.

    @deprecated This is provided as a workaround for existing
    users. Please switch to "set state, then subscribe" or other usage
    pattern.

    @param p The pubnub context. Can't be NULL
    @param channel The string with the channel name (or comma-delimited list
    of channel names) to subscribe to.
    @param channel_group The string with the channel group name (or
    comma-delimited list of channel group names) to subscribe to.
    @param state A string with a JSON object which identifies the state

    @return #PNR_STARTED on success, an error otherwise
    
    @see pubnub_subscribe
