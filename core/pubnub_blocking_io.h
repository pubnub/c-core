/** @file pubnub_blocking_io.h 
    This is the "Blocking I/O" API of the Pubnub client library.
    Functions here influence the way that Pubnub client library
    works with lower levels (the TCP/IP stack).

    It is available on platforms that support setting blocking /
    non-blocking behavior. Be aware that, even on such platforms,
    most of these functions provide more of a hint, rather than
    a command.

/** Sets the usage of non-blocking I/O for a context. If non-blocking
    I/O is supported by a platform, it will be used, unless some other
    reason prevents it. 

    The exact behavior when using non-blocking I/O depends on the
    platform, but, in general:

    - getting (or trying to get) the outcome of a Pubnub transaction
    will not block the caller's thread

    - if outcome is gotten by polling (calling a Punbub SDK API to get
    the outcome), each poll will indicate whether the outcome is
    reached or not, so user will have to "call until the outcome is
    reached", though the user, is, of course, free to do other things
    between two "poll calls"

    - if outcome is gotten via a callback or similar means, it is most
    likely that the actual I/O is done non-blocking anyway, but, in
    any case, user would probably see little difference between
    blocking and non-blocking I/O

    In general, non-blocking I/O gives to more complex code, but that
    scales better.
