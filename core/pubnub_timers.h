/** @file pubnub_timers.h
    This is the "Timer" API of the Pubnub client library, pertaining
    to transaction timeout(s), that is the time limit on how long
    we allow a transaction to last before it finishes.

    Functions here influence the way that Pubnub client library works
    with lower levels (the TCP/IP stack) with respect to how long will
    an operation be waited upon to complete.

    It is available in most platforms, but the exact way it behaves
    may have noticable differences. In general, the actual timeout
    will be _at_ _least_ as the specified by the user, but, it may
    actually be more.

    its timeout can be changed, it will be changed, but if it can't,

    Pubnub SDKs, in general, distinguish the "subscribe" timeout and
    other transactions, but, C-core doesn't, to save space, as most
    contexts are either used for subscribe or for other transactions.

    If timer support is available, pubnub_init() will set a default timeout,
    which is configurable at compile time. So, if the default timeout is
    fine with you, you don't have to call this function.
