    @retval pbccFalse It doesn't benefit you to re-try the same
    transaction.

    @retval pbccTrue It's safe to retry, though there is no guarantee
    that it will help.

    @retval pbccNotSet Retry might help, but, it also can make things
    worse. For example, for a #PNR_TIMEOUT, it may very well be that
    the message was delivered to Pubnub, but, the response from Pubnub
    never reached us due to some networking issue, resulting in a
    timeout.  In that case, retrying would send the same message
    again, duplicating it.
