/** @file pubnub_proxy.h

    This is the "Proxy" API of the Pubnub client library.  Functions
    here influence the way that Pubnub client library works with
    Internet proxies.

    C-core supports various proxies, and various ways of configuring
    them. Depending on your configuration, you may not be utlizing
    some of those - maybe even none of those.

    This API provides only the two main methods of configuring the
    proxy server: manual and "from system configuration". API for
    other methods of configuring the proxy, like the WPAD(+PAC)
    protocol, if they exist on your platform, is provided separately.

    The Pubnub network doesn't use HTTP authentication, but your proxy
    server might (if it uses HTTP itself as the "proxy protocol").
    So, here we also have API for setting HTTP authentication options,
    rather than it being in some "more general place".
